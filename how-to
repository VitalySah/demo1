This script will check network addresses on your server and will report you lowwest IP used on that network.

How to run this script:

1. Create text file with list IP's which you want to scan. For example name of file will be "list".
2. Create ssh key under user root with follow command: ssh-keygen -t rsa
3. Copy new created key to you server by command: for ip in `cat list`; do ssh-copy-id $ip; done
4. Validate if you can login as root without password: for ip in `cat list`; do ssh $ip hostname ; done. You should get list of hostname of each server.
5. Be shure that you "list"  file located in same directory with the script.
6. Be shure that script have executable permissions.
7. Run the script: ./homework.sh

That's all, folks :)
